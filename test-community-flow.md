# Community Feature Testing Guide

## Full End-to-End Community Flow Test

### Phase 1: Community Creation
1. **Navigate to Homepage**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Sign In**: Click "Login" button and authenticate with Clerk
3. **Find a Startup**: Look for startup cards on the homepage
4. **Create Community**: Click "Create Community" button on any startup card
5. **Fill Community Form**: 
   - Community Name: "Test Community"
   - Description: "This is a test community for our startup"
   - Set as Public
   - Allow Guest Posts: Yes
6. **Submit**: Click "Create Community" button
7. **Verify Redirect**: Should redirect to community page

### Phase 2: Community Interface Testing
1. **Community Header**: Verify startup info, member count, post count
2. **Tab Navigation**: Test Feed, Members, Events, Analytics tabs
3. **Community Settings**: If founder, verify management options

### Phase 3: Post Creation & Social Features
1. **Post Composer**: 
   - Write a test post: "Hello from our startup community! ðŸš€"
   - Test character counter
   - Try adding emojis
   - Test file attachment (optional)
2. **Submit Post**: Click "Post" button
3. **Verify Post Display**: Post should appear in feed immediately

### Phase 4: Social Interaction Testing

2. **Comments**: Click comment button (placeholder for now)
3. **Sharing**: Test share functionality (copies URL)
4. **Feed Refresh**: Test refresh button

### Phase 5: API Endpoint Testing
Test API endpoints directly:

```bash
# Test community creation (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/communities \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "API Test Community",
    "description": "Created via API",
    "startupId": "STARTUP_ID_HERE",
    "isPublic": true,
    "allowGuestPosts": true
  }'

# Test post creation (requires authentication)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/communities/COMMUNITY_ID/posts \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "content": "Test post from API"
  }'

# Test getting posts
curl http://localhost:3000/api/communities/COMMUNITY_ID/posts
```
